# TalentPulse AI - Engineering Diary

This diary documents non-trivial architecture challenges, technical decisions, alternatives explored, and outcomes achieved.

## Task 01 - Monorepo Bootstrap & Project Foundation

### Problem
Monorepo architectures can suffer from build friction and dependency divergence across micro-packages for types, schemas, and configurations.

### Decision
Consolidate cross-cutting Zod schemas and inferred TypeScript types into a single `@talentpulse/shared` package.

### Alternative
Create separate `@talentpulse/types`, `@talentpulse/validation`, and `@talentpulse/config` packages.

### Why
Merging into `@talentpulse/shared` eliminates multiple build steps, avoids cyclic workspace dependencies, and simplifies packaging between Next.js and Express.

### Result
Monorepo workspace initialized cleanly with uniform TypeScript configurations and fast compile times.

## Task 06 - Authentication & Authorization Architecture

### Problem
Multi-tenant recruitment platforms require secure access control, protection against stolen refresh tokens, and programmatic ingest capabilities without storing API keys in plaintext.

### Decision
Implement short-lived JWT access tokens held purely in client memory paired with cryptographically random 48-byte refresh tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes in PostgreSQL and delivered via HttpOnly cookies.
Enforce family-based refresh token rotation where reuse of any previously revoked token terminates and revokes the entire token family.
Implement role-based access control with ADMIN, RECRUITER, and ANALYST roles, and generate high-entropy prefix-hashed API keys for ingestion routes.

### Alternative
Store long-lived access tokens or session state directly in client localStorage, or use external SaaS authentication like Auth0/Clerk.

### Why
Self-contained JWT with family token rotation provides zero-trust security without external vendor costs or latency.
Keeping access tokens in memory prevents XSS extraction, while HttpOnly cookies with SameSite lax prevent CSRF attacks.
Hashing refresh tokens and API keys with SHA-256 ensures that even a database snapshot leak will not compromise live client credentials.

### Result
End-to-end authentication and authorization flow verified across Express and Next.js.
Passes full test suite including rotation, token reuse detection, cross-tenant isolation, role boundaries, and API key authentication.
Smoke test scripts in bash and PowerShell execute all steps successfully against live endpoints.

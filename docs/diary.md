# TalentPulse AI - Engineering Diary

This diary documents non-trivial architecture challenges, technical decisions, alternatives explored, and outcomes achieved.

## Task 01 - Monorepo Bootstrap & Project Foundation

### Problem
Monorepo architectures can suffer from build friction and dependency divergence across micro-packages for types, schemas, and configurations.

### Decision
Consolidate cross-cutting Zod schemas and inferred TypeScript types into a single `@talentpulse/shared` package.

### Alternative
Create separate `@talentpulse/types`, `@talentpulse/validation`, and `@talentpulse/config` packages.

### Why
Merging into `@talentpulse/shared` eliminates multiple build steps, avoids cyclic workspace dependencies, and simplifies packaging between Next.js and Express.

### Result
Monorepo workspace initialized cleanly with uniform TypeScript configurations and fast compile times.
